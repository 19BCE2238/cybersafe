                The University of Oxford on Tuesday said a probe is underway and that it "investigates thoroughly" every complaint related to harassment or equality, following allegations of cyber bullying surrounding Rashmi Samant, the first Indian woman to be elected President of the Oxford Student Union (SU) who was forced to resign amidst controversy over some of her past social media posts.
Some British Hindu groups have also raised concerns around comments made online by a university staffer from the history faculty with the local Thames Valley Police, urging an investigation into a possible hate crime.

The police force confirmed that it has "received a report of an alleged hate incident".

The comments under scrutiny, posted with an image of Ms Samant's family on Instagram by Dr Abhijit Sarkar, made references to their Hindu faith and also categorised their home state of Karnataka as a "bastion of Islamophobic forces".

"An investigation into these online comments is ongoing and we must allow time for this formal process to be followed. In cases such as these, student support is provided through their college and department," an Oxford University spokesperson said.</p></div>

                The Delhi Government has directed schools in the national capital to sensitise students and parents about cyber bullying and online threats during COVID-19 pandemic and how to protect children from these risks.

                <p>In a letter to school heads, the Directorate of Education (DoE) said school education has shifted from the carefree days of learning together in the safe school environment to online mode of gaining knowledge during COVID-19.
                    "The internet spaces are growing and multiplying and data security, privacy and protection is inadequate to keep a check on this. It is important that everyone is aware of the risks that could be associated with being connected to internet," the Directorate of Education (DoE) said in a letter to schools.
                    
                    "In addition, the students need to be warned against these risks and it is extremely important for us to ensure that every possible step is taken towards giving our children safe spaces to learn that keep their innocence and cater to their curiosity in a non-harmful way," it added.</p>

                <p>Body-shaming over the internet can range from unpleasant sarcastic and snide remarks to blatant fat-shaming, nasty comments and objectification.


                    Dr Kedar Tilwe, Psychiatrist and Sexologist at Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi - A Fortis Network Hospital says that the anonymity offered by platforms and the inherent insecurity of the 'troll' can sometimes combine to make a morbid virtual safe-haven for people to shed social etiquettes. The end result is comments which are not only unsavoury but downright petty and malicious. When one is exposed to body-shaming, it can directly lower self-esteem, self-worth and may cause a confidence crisis for the victim. It may be responsible for precipitation of major psychiatric illnesses such as depression, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and body dysmorphic disorder.</p>

                "I could say I'm the most bullied person on the world," Melania Trump told ABC News in an interview that took place during her trip this month to Africa.
                
                When pressed, the US First Lady said that she could certainly be "one of them, if you really see what people saying about me."
                
                That, she said, is "why my 'Be Best' initiative is focusing on social media and online behavior." 
                
                ABC on Thursday released clips of the interview ahead of a longer piece set to air Friday.

                        <p>Teenage girls are twice as likely as boys to show depressive symptoms linked to social media use — mainly due to online harassment and disturbed sleep, as well as poor body image and lower self-esteem, researchers said on 4 January 2018.</p><figure class="figure">

                    </figure><p>In a study analysing data from nearly 11,000 young people in Britain, researchers found that 14-year-old girls were heavier users of social media, with two-fifths of them using it for more than three hours a day, compared with a fifth of boys.The study also found that 12 percent of light social media users and 38 percent of heavy social media users (five-plus hours a day) showed signs of having more severe depression.

                        When the researchers looked at underlying processes that might be linked with social media use and depression, they found 40 percent of girls and 25 percent of boys had experience of online harassment or cyberbullying. Disrupted sleep was reported by 40 percent of girls compared with 28 percent of boys. Anxiety and poor sleep are both linked to depression.
                        
                        Girls were also more affected when it came to social media use and concerns about body image, self-esteem and appearance, the researchers found, but here the gap with boys was smaller.
